This is a very buggy Login password manager app.(I will propably make a better version)

What it is:
It is an application which helps you manage your login information of any app. You can create and store new passwords for new apps or you can vew and edit old passwods. That way you'll never have to remeber your passwords. ALL OF YOUR PASSWORDS GET STORED INSIDE YOUR OWN SYSTEM.

How to use:
1. Run the Login.py file.
2. Sign in the app using the login info inside the login.txt file.
3. Follow the simple instructions.
